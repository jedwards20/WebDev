<p> <strong>Gloria Dominguez - Executive Chef</strong></p>
<p>A native from Mixtlan in the state of Jalisco, Gloria opened Tamarindo Antojeria Mexicana in 2005 with her son Alfonso Dominguez. Drawing from a desire to learn more about pre-hispanic food in Mexico and master the ingredients that her ancestors used, Gloria’s main goal is to research and master all the ingredients that are present in Mexican cuisine. This passion to learn from her roots has formed her career as a Chef, crafting dishes straight from the heart. </p>
<p> <strong>Alfonso Dominguez - Co-owner</strong></p>
<p>An architect by training, Alfonso’s concept for Tamarindo blends both classical and contemporary elements of Mexican design. With the interior, he sought to create an upbeat and welcoming dining experience that communicates his experiences and inspirations from his travels in Mexico. Raised with a strong traditional Mexican cuisine in his household, this project was a natural venture for him to represent his culture in culinary and social experience.</p>
